"""WorkflowContext — a deterministic mini workflow engine.

A workflow is a plain async function ``async def fn(ctx, args) -> Any`` in which
ordinary Python code (not an LLM lead) orchestrates one-shot agent sessions.
This is a structured generalization of ``harness.evaluator.run_eval_task`` — it
does not touch the Scheduler's pending-row / wake machinery.

The context exposes a handful of primitives:

* ``agent`` — run one one-shot session, return its final assistant text.
* ``parallel`` — fan out thunks through a shared concurrency semaphore.
* ``pipeline`` — flow each item through ordered stages with no inter-stage
  barrier (item A may be in stage 2 while item B is still in stage 1).
* ``phase`` / ``log`` — observability, no-ops when no sink/tracer is wired.
* ``budget`` — live token accounting across every session created so far.

All failure handling is local: a single dead agent, thunk, or pipeline stage
yields ``None`` for that unit of work and never aborts the fleet. The sole
exception that escapes is ``WorkflowBudgetExceeded``, raised by ``agent`` only
when the shared budget is already exhausted *before* a call starts.

Pure application layer: domain + stdlib imports only.
